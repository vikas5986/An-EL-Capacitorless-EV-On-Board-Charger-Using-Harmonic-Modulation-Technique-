# An-EL-Capacitorless-EV-On-Board-Charger-Using-Harmonic-Modulation-Technique-
Designed and simulated an electrolytic capacitor-less EV on-board charger using resonant and interleaved DCM boost converters â€“ Implemented harmonic modulation control in MATLAB/Simulink to enhance efficiency and achieve near-unity power factor.
